juvharebyyear$mean <- mean(juvharebyyear$trappings)
juvharebyyear$median <- median(juvharebyyear$trappings)


ggplot(data = juvharebyyear, aes(x = year, y = trappings)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  theme_light()
```


```{r}
juvhare <- hares %>% 
  filter(age=="j") %>% 
  mutate(date = mdy(date)) %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date)) %>% 
  group_by(grid) 


ggplot(data = juvhare, aes(x = grid, y = weight)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  facet_wrap(~sex) +
  theme_light()
  

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
